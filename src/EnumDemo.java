//Quick demonstration for enum type

//enum is a special type of class that groups together constant values to make your code
//more readable. They do not add any functionality, but can add readability. 

//My main purpose in introducing them is to make sure you recognize them in other code and
//provide you with another tool you can use if you choose. 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class EnumDemo
{

    //Let's create a system of classifications for users on our system. This
    //classification can determine their access to certain parts of our application.

    //1. Create an enum type called Level that has values "LOW", "MEDIUM", AND "HIGH."
    // Why create it here instead of in main?

    enum Level{LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH};


    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        //2. Create an enum variable to hold the value of your user.

        Level level;

        //3. Request the level of access from the prompt in the form of 1. for high; 2. for medium; or three for low

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Please enter name");
        String name = sc.next();
        System.out.println("Please enter access level 1, 2, or 3");
        int selection = sc.nextInt();
		

		switch(selection)
		{	
			case 1:  level = Level.HIGH;
			break;
			case 2:  level = Level.MEDIUM;
			break;
			default:  level = Level.LOW;
		}


        //4. Create a user with this level of access

        User u1 = new User(name, level);

        //5. Print the level of access based on the created user's set access

        System.out.println("Attempting to grant access to " + u1.getName());
		

		switch(u1.getLevel())
		{	
			case HIGH: System.out.println("maximum access granted");
			break;
			case MEDIUM: System.out.println("mid access granted");
			break;
			default: System.out.println("minimal access granted");
		}

    }

    //I'm placing this class inside of the Enum class.
    //Surprise this is something you can do. :)
    //You likely want to declare the class static though.
    //At this level don't worry about why. Just know it works.
